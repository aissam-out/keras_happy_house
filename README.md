# keras_happy_house

Keras was developed to enable deep learning engineers to build and experiment with different models very quickly. Just as TensorFlow is a higher-level framework than Python, Keras is an even higher-level framework and provides additional abstractions.

Keras offers consistent & simple APIs, it minimizes the number of user actions required for common use cases, and it provides clear and actionable feedback upon user error.

In this project, we are implementing the "Happy House" problem

For your next vacation, you decided to spend a week with five of your friends from school. It is a very convenient house with many things to do nearby. But the most important benefit is that everybody has commited to be happy when they are in the house. So anyone wanting to enter the house must prove their current state of happiness.

As a deep learning expert, to make sure the "Happy" rule is strictly applied, you are going to build an algorithm which that uses pictures from the front door camera to check if the person is happy or not. The door should open only if the person is happy.

You have gathered pictures of your friends and yourself, taken by the front-door camera. The dataset is labbeled: 1-"happy" 0-"not happy"

if you are not doing some research purpose work or developing some special kind of neural network, then go for Keras (trust me, I am a Keras fan!!). And itâ€™s super easy to quickly build even very complex models in Keras.

This dataset can be used to solve the Happy House problem. Where, we allow a person to enter the house only if he/she is smiling! So, a smile detector!

The train set has 600 examples. The test set has 150 examples.

Source: This dataset is gathered from the Deep Learning Specialization - Convolutional Neural Network Course - Week 2 - Happy House Exercise.
